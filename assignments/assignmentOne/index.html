    <h1>Some things about me!</h1>
    <p>My name is Alex, and I am currently a senior majoring in CIS! This is my final full semester before I start my Capstone project in the fall. 
        My goal is to land a job in a big city, preferably NYC. I've grown up in rural SC my entire life so I want a change of scenery.</p>
<br>
    <p>Two of my main hobbies include collecting sneakers & cars! I currently own over 20 pairs of shoes and counting. 
        I'm also into cars heavily and I even run my own car instgram page. I also like traveling a lot, I will be in NYC in two weeks and plan for South Korea after I graduate!</p>
